Every Wednesday, we’re opening the stage to musicians of all kinds—bring your axe, your voice, your full band, or just the urge to play. When you arrive, find Melissa to sign up and lock in your spot. High-Hand’s pro backline will be ready for you. Solo players will be paired up into spontaneous jam groups, and together you’ll decide what to play—keeping it loose, creative, and fun. It’s all about rocking out, connecting with fellow musicians, and celebrating the amazing music community we’re surrounded by. Each week will also feature a guest band to keep the night energized and inspiring. Come jam, hang out, and make your Wednesday groove. Only guests 18 and older may attend our &#8220;On Stage&#8221; concerts.",

      "description": "Join us at High-Hand Brewery as we launch our new Hump Day Jam Nite! Every Wednesday, we’re opening the stage to musicians of all kinds—bring your axe, your voice, your full band, or just the urge to play. When you arrive, find Melissa to sign up and lock in your spot. High-Hand’s pro backline will be ready for you. Solo players will be paired up into spontaneous jam groups, and together you’ll decide what to play—keeping it loose, creative, and fun. It’s all about rocking out, connecting with fellow musicians, and celebrating the amazing music community we’re surrounded by. Each week will also feature a guest band to keep the night energized and inspiring. Come jam, hang out, and make your Wednesday groove. Only guests 18 and older may attend our &#8220;On Stage&#8221; concerts.",

      "description": "Come join us at High-Hand Brewery to hear a live performance by 120 Minutes. Sacramento’s ultimate time machine to the golden age of rock — this powerhouse band slams through the best of 90’s and early 2000’s alternative, grunge, and hard-hitting rock with raw energy and a rebel soul. Fronted by both the gritty vocals of Jon Grant and Owen Myers, the band features their ripping guitar work and keyboard melodies, respectively. Guitarists Alex Schmidt and Brian Ilagan shred with precision and passion, while Dave Wong lays down the thunder on bass and Gar Garvey keeps the heartbeat pounding on drums. From the anthems of The Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains to the pulse of Foo Fighters, CAKE, Bush and more, 120 Minutes doesn’t just play the soundtrack of a generation—they ignite it. This band is a must-see for anyone who ever wore Doc Martens, blasted their car stereo, or just wanted to rock without apology. Get ready to relive the era when guitars ruled, angst was an art form, and every track hit like a shot of adrenaline. 120 Minutes brings it all back—louder, tighter, and harder than ever. Are you ready to feel it again? You can learn more about them by clicking here to visit their website. Only guests 18 and older may attend our &#8220;On Stage&#8221; concerts.",

      "description": "Come join us at High-Hand Brewery to hear a live performance by 120 Minutes. Sacramento’s ultimate time machine to the golden age of rock — this powerhouse band slams through the best of 90’s and early 2000’s alternative, grunge, and hard-hitting rock with raw energy and a rebel soul. Fronted by both the gritty vocals of Jon Grant and Owen Myers, the band features their ripping guitar work and keyboard melodies, respectively. Guitarists Alex Schmidt and Brian Ilagan shred with precision and passion, while Dave Wong lays down the thunder on bass and Gar Garvey keeps the heartbeat pounding on drums. From the anthems of The Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains to the pulse of Foo Fighters, CAKE, Bush and more, 120 Minutes doesn’t just play the soundtrack of a generation—they ignite it. This band is a must-see for anyone who ever wore Doc Martens, blasted their car stereo, or just wanted to rock without apology. Get ready to relive the era when guitars ruled, angst was an art form, and every track hit like a shot of adrenaline. 120 Minutes brings it all back—louder, tighter, and harder than ever.
